# RTConvolver
RTConvolver is a real-time GPU-powered convolution plugin (VST3) designed for high-performance audio processing.


## Setup in DAW
To set up RTConvolver in your DAW, follow these steps:
1. Create a track with 4 channels and load plugin.
2. Route a stereo signal to channels 1 and 2.
3. Route a different stereo signal to channels 3 and 4.

This allows RTConvolver to process two separate stereo signals simultaneously.
